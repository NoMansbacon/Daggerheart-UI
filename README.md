# Daggerheart Tooltips (DH-UI)

An Obsidian plugin for **Daggerheart** that turns fenced code blocks into rich, live-updating character sheet UI.

Use simple Markdown + YAML to render traits, vitals, trackers, rest controls, damage calculators, badges, domain/equipment pickers, and more – all driven by your note frontmatter.

> **Warning**
> This plugin is under active development. Things may change or break between versions.
