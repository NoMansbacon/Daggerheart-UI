#  Level Up

The Level Up feature gives you a dedicated UI for advancing a character. It can be launched in two ways:

1. From the Level Up button in a rest block.  
2. From a standalone levelup code block.

Both open the same Level Up modal, tied to the current character note.

> For an overview of all blocks, including rest and vitals, see the [Code Block Reference](/blocks).

What the Level Up modal does (conceptually)

The Level Up modal is responsible for:

•  Reading the current character’s note (frontmatter, level, domains, etc.).  
•  Walking you through your level‑up steps (per your house rules).  
•  Triggering Domain card selection via the Domain Picker when appropriate  
  (e.g. “Add 1 new Domain card at this level”).  

The exact sequence inside the modal is configurable in plugin settings, but from the note’s perspective you just need a way to open it.

Level Up via rest block

You can add a Level Up button into your rest controls row. When clicked, it:

•  Resolves the current note file.  
•  Opens the Level Up modal for that character.  
•  Shows a notice if it can’t resolve a file (very rare in normal use).

## Example – Rest bar with Level Up

![Level Up options example](../images/example_levelup_options.webp)

````yaml
```rest
styleClass: 

# Rest buttons
show_short: true
show_long: true

# Turn on the Level Up button
show_levelup: true
levelup_label: "Level Up"

# Optional: other controls off
show_full_heal: false
show_reset_all: false
```
````

This adds a **“Level Up”** button alongside your Short / Long Rest buttons.

### Relevant `rest` options for Level Up

| Property        | Type    | Default      | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `show_levelup`  | Boolean | `false`      | Whether to show the Level Up button.            |
| `levelup_label` | String  | `"Level Up"` | Label text for the Level Up button.             |
| `styleClass`    | String  | _none_       | Styling hook for the whole rest control row.    |

> The Level Up handler in `rest` always targets the **current note** (the one containing the block).

## Standalone `levelup` block

If you want a dedicated Level Up area, you can also use the `levelup` code block. It doesn’t accept YAML options; it simply renders a button that opens the same Level Up modal.

### Example – Inline Level Up button

````yaml
```levelup
  levelup_label:
  styleClass:
```
````
