# Templates & Events

Anywhere you can provide a string in block YAML, you can usually use templates like {{ frontmatter.hp }}.  
Templates are evaluated against a shared template context and are supported in blocks such as badges, features, vitals, trackers, consumables, experiences, damage, and more.

If a template expression fails, it resolves to an empty string instead of throwing. When a number is expected and the result isn’t numeric, it is treated as 0.

## Template paths

These are the main paths you can use inside {{ ... }}:

•  frontmatter.* – raw note frontmatter.
◦  Examples:
▪  {{ frontmatter.level }}
▪  {{ frontmatter.hp_max }}
•  abilities.* – totals derived from the nearest ```traits block in the same section.
◦  The plugin parses that block and computes final scores, then exposes them in a case‑insensitive map.
◦  Examples:
▪  {{ abilities.agility }}
▪  {{ abilities.knowledge }}
•  skills.* – numeric skills/moves from skills in frontmatter.
◦  Supports either:
▪  A map:  
      skills: { attack: 2, sneak: 3 }
•  Or a list:  
      skills: [ { name: "attack", value: 2 }, { name: "sneak", value: 3 } ]
•  Examples:
◦  {{ skills.attack }}
◦  {{ skills.sneak }}
•  character.* – derived summary from frontmatter.
◦  Fields include:
▪  character.name – typically from name or title.
▪  character.level – from level or tier (whichever is present).
▪  character.tier – from tier or level.
▪  character.hp, character.stress, character.armor, character.hope – from corresponding frontmatter (hp/health/din_health, etc.).
◦  Examples:
▪  {{ character.level }}
▪  {{ character.hp }}

You can also use bare numbers and these paths as arguments to helper functions (see next section).

## Helper functions

The template engine provides a few simple helpers for math and formatting. They work like:

•  {{ add 2 frontmatter.level }}  
•  {{ subtract frontmatter.hp 2 }}  
•  {{ multiply 2 frontmatter.level }}  
•  {{ divide frontmatter.hp 2 }}  
•  {{ floor divide frontmatter.hp 2 }}

Supported helpers:

•  add a b c ... – sum of all arguments.  
•  subtract a b c ... – a - b - c - ....  
•  multiply a b c ... – product of all arguments.  
•  divide a b c ... – a / b / c / ... (division by zero yields NaN → treated as 0 when a number is needed).  
•  floor x – Math.floor(x).  
•  ceil x – Math.ceil(x).  
•  round x – Math.round(x).  
•  modifier x – pass‑through numeric value (mainly for readability, e.g. {{ modifier abilities.agility }}).

Arguments can be:

•  Plain numbers: 2, 3.5, -1.  
•  Template paths: frontmatter.level, abilities.agility, skills.attack, character.hp.

If a token cannot be parsed as a number, it is treated as 0 for numeric helpers.


## Events

The plugin fires custom DOM events so different blocks and integrations can react to changes.

Core events:

•  dh:tracker:changed – emitted when a tracker row (HP/Stress/Armor/Hope/uses/etc.) changes.
◦  Detail: { key, filled }
▪  key: the tracker’s state key (e.g. din_health).
▪  filled: current number of filled boxes.
•  dh:kv:changed – emitted when a key in the KV/state store changes.
◦  Detail: { key, val }
▪  key: the KV key that changed.
▪  val: the new value.
•  dh:rest:short – emitted when a Short Rest is applied.
•  dh:rest:long – emitted when a Long Rest is applied.
◦  Detail for both rest events:  
    { filePath, hpKey, stressKey, armorKey, hopeKey }

These are primarily for advanced users writing custom JS snippets or other plugins.

If you’re extending DH‑UI in code, prefer using the helpers from src/utils/events.ts:

•  Emitters:
◦  emitTrackerChanged({ key, filled })
◦  emitKvChanged({ key, val })
◦  emitRestShort({ filePath, hpKey, stressKey, armorKey, hopeKey })
◦  emitRestLong({ filePath, hpKey, stressKey, armorKey, hopeKey })
•  Listeners (return an unsubscribe function):
◦  onTrackerChanged(handler)
◦  onKvChanged(handler)
◦  onRestShort(handler)
◦  onRestLong(handler)

Using these helpers keeps event names and payload shapes consistent across the plugin.
