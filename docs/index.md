1. Copy this plugin folder into your vault under `.obsidian/plugins/daggerheart-tooltips` (or install it using your preferred Obsidian community plugin workflow).
2. In the plugin folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins** and enable **Daggerheart Tooltips**.
4. Create a note and add one of the supported fenced code blocks, for example:

   ```markdown
   ```traits
   # no YAML needed – reads from frontmatter and your abilities config
   ```
   ```

5. Adjust your note's frontmatter (e.g. `level`, `hp`, `stress`, `domains`, etc.) and watch the UI update.
