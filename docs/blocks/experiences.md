# Experiences (`experiences`)

Use the `experiences` block to list your character's key experiences. These are story hooks you and your GM can reference during play.

```markdown
```experiences
items:
  - name: "Saved by the Stranger"
    note: "You owe a favor to the mysterious stranger who pulled you from the river."
  - name: "Haunted by the Flames"
    note: "You survived a village fire that still stalks your dreams."
```
```

Single‑experience shorthand:

```markdown
```experiences
name: "Marked by the Old Gods"
note: "You bear a strange symbol that reacts to ancient magic."
```
```

How to use in play (rules reminder): when you and your GM agree an experience is relevant, you can **spend 1 Hope** to **add +2** to a roll that fits that experience. This plugin just helps you track the text; you apply the +2 modifier yourself when you roll.
